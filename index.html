				Nevertheless, ambient remains an extremely vague concept, since this term can refer to performers of various
				other genres, for example, performers of "academic" experimental electronics (Chris Meloche, David
				Shea, Asmus Tietchens, David Toop), space music (Robert Rich, Steve Roach, Vidna Obmana, Klaus Schulze,
				Jeff Greinke, Alio Die), dub (Bill Laswell, The Orb, Mick Harris, Drome, Woob), ethno electronics (Jon
				Hassell, Banco de Gaia, Astralasia), industrial (Lustmord, Merzbow, Final, Aube, James Plotkin), club
				culture hybrids (The KLF, Global Communication, Mixmaster Morris, Biosphere, Higher Intelligence Agency,
				Sun Electric, Tetsu Inoue, David Moufang, LTJ Bukem, Autechre).
			</p>
			<p>
				In 2002, music producer Jeff Tone and journalist Peter Manzi of New Age Voice Magazine ranked the top
				ambient albums of all time. Experts were invited to select applicants, among whom were musicians Steve Roach
				, Robert Rich, the founder of the record company Hearts of Space Stephen Hill and others. As a result,
				the experts chose "25 major ambient albums of all time". This ranking includes both the classic works of
				Brian Eno and Steve Roach, as well as albums commonly classified as progressive rock. ( Tangerine Dream ),
				electronic music (Constantin Grand , Jean Ven Robert Hal , Aphex Twin , The Orb) and even jazz (Miles
				Davis). Thus, the very definition of the concept of "ambient" was significantly expanded.
			</p>

				Ambient is often heard in film and video game soundtracks, especially fantasy ones . Notable films with
				ambient sound design:

					â€” from the liner notes of Brian Eno's 1978 album Ambient 1: Music for Airports
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>
				Brian Eno's albums Ambient 1 - Music for Airport (1978) and Ambient 4 - On Land (1982) served as milestones
				in the development of ambient as a style. Ambient 1 - Music for Airport contains soft, light intonations and
				is close to academic music: acoustic piano, female three-parts formed the basis of the album. Ambient 4 - On
				Land - a darker and more experimental canvas, in addition to live musicians, ethnic and noise percussion,
				field and concrete recordings were used here.

			<div class="paragraphs-history">
				<p>
					One of the early forerunners of ambient was the furniture music of the innovative French composer Eric
					Satie. He invented it in 1914-1916, and according to his own idea, furniture music should serve as a
					background for everyday life, shopping in a store, receiving guests, eating in a restaurant, and all
					other
					daily activities. The basic principle of constructing new music was the arbitrary repetition of one or
					more
					sound cells (or a thematic phrase) an unlimited number of times.
				</p>
				<p class="paragraph__text">
					Furnishing music became the basis for minimalism, another immediate forerunner of ambient. Half a century
					after Satie, American composer John Milton Cage discovers furnishing music and creates his own minimalist
					works based on it. A few years later, Steve Reich, John Adams, Philip Glass and many others will follow
					his path.
				</p>
				<p>
					In 1968, Holger Shukai recorded the Canaxis album, overlaying electronic hum on an accidentally
					discovered
					tape of Vietnamese folk songs. According to Gorokhov, this was ambient. A lot of different music of the
					early 1970s reached almost ambient. For example, Bob Norten and other jazz artists, or the Gravity
					Adjusters Expansion Band. Pioneers of electronic music Mike Oldfield, Jean-Michel Jarre, Klaus Schulze,
					Vangelis, Eduard Artemyev created ambient compositions, as well as progressive rock figures - Pink Floyd,
					Yes. Kraut rock bands Tangerine Dream, Popol Vuh, Can, Kraftwerk made major contributions.

				<p class="paragraph-appearance__one">
					The term "ambient" appeared in the 70s of the XX century, to refer to music that, according to Brian Eno
					,
					can be "actively listened to with attention, or simply ignored, depending on the choice of the listener."
					Brian Eno is credited with coining the term into music. According to the prevailing legend, the idea of
					creating music, today called ambient, came to Ino's head when he was lying at home with a fracture and,
					for
					lack of other things to do, listened to the noises and sounds coming from the street. In them, he caught
					a
					certain regularity and musicality.
				</p>
				<p>
					Brian Eno (former keyboardist for Roxy Music) moved from rock music to the field of experimental music
					and
					in 1975 discovered the technical side of the process of obtaining an enveloping sound, which consists in
					getting the original signal through a graphic equalizer into two tape recorders connected in parallel, in
					which the sound is reproduced with a delay at a certain interval, then from one tape recorder,
					additionally
					processed, it is output to the speaker system, and from another tape recorder it returns to the initial
					conversion point. According to Eno himself, the sound transformed through his "ambient system" is
					perceived
					as "part of the vibrations of the environment, like the color of a calm diffused light or the rustle of
					rain." Eno also formulated the second important principle of ambient - the development of music at its
					own
					expense, giving the performer the role of a passive creator.

				Eno acknowledged the influence of <span class="span__in-p">Eric Satie</span>, John Cage, as well as the
				influence of the drone music of La Monte Young (of which he said "La Monte Young is our dad") and the mood
				music of Miles Davis, especially his epic piece "He Loved Him Madly" ("He loved him madly") from the 1974
				album Get Up with It, of which Eno wrote that "the piece felt 'spacious', a quality I often returned to."

				Knock Bambuk at 11 o'clock is a Soviet musical group formed in the late 1980s. In their music, they

				the band ceased to exist.

			<h3 id="development_in_the_1990s">Development in the 1990s</h3>
			<p>
				Since the early 1990s, a whole wave of new artists have emerged who continue to develop ambient in various
				sub-genres and derivative genres. Ambient sound is now emphasized by rhythm or melody. Derived genres
				ambient house, ambient techno, IDM, downbeat, downtempo, ambient dub, ambient breakbeat, illbient are
				rhythmic ambient, and in most cases instrumental (exceptions: downbeat and downtempo).
			</p>
			<ul class="history-list">
				<li>The term ambient house indiscriminately referred to 1990s artists (The Orb, The KLF, Irresistible
					Force, Future Sound of London, Orbital), both performing dance music and not necessarily. In a
					stricter sense, ambient house combines certain elements of ambient and acid house. Subsequently, it was
					replaced by more specific terms and is rarely used.
				</li>
				<li>
					A specific reorientation of the term ambient house is ambient techno, which is usually applied to B12,
					early Aphex Twin, The Black Dog, Higher Intelligence Agency, Biosphere and others. These artists are
					distinguished by their closeness to the techno and electro genres and are most often released on the
					labels Apollo, GPR, Warp and others. Over time, the term ambient techno evolved into IDM without any
					stylistic changes in the music.
				</li>
				<li>
					IDM was the reaction of dance music producers to accusations of the latter's stupid monotony. There have
					been attempts to name the genre differently: "electronic listening music" (Warp Records version) or
					"braindance" (Aphex Twin version). Artists like Mixmaster Morris and Dr. Alex Paterson mixed Chicago
					house, softer synthpop and ambient, creating a new wave inspired by a variety of sources. Warp Records'
					Artificial Intelligence compilation introduced half a dozen of the style's most important exponents to
					listeners around the world: Aphex Twin, The Orb, Plastikman, Autechre, The Black Dog and B12.
				</li>
				<li>
					Given the amount and variety of ambient music in the 1990s, the term downbeat is sometimes used to
					replace such concepts as ambient house and ambient techno, however, in its broadest definition, downbeat
					is electronic music for the house, not for the dance floor. Representatives: Morcheeba, Thievery
					Corporation, Jazzanova, Zero 7, Howie B.
				</li>
				<li>
					Similar to downbeat is the downtempo genre, where the performers are more beat-oriented than the ambient
					component, but not as much as in trip-hop. Representatives: Gang Gang Dance, Rhye, Dobie.
				</li>
				<li>
					Since the English label Beyond Records released a series of albums called "Ambient Dub" in the early
					1990s, the term ambient dub has been used to refer to rhythmic ambient performers incorporating elements
					of Jamaican dub (e.g. reverb, emphasis on bass and drums, heavy use effects). Although the term ambient
					dub has fallen out of fashion, it remains useful for referring to a denser sub-type of downtempo.
					Representatives include The Orb, Techno Animal, Automaton, Solar Quest.
				</li>
				<li>
					There is also an ambient breakbeat with a strong hip hop influence, but less energetic than trip hop.
					Prominent examples are DJ Wally and Req.
				</li>
				<li>
					Illbient is based on ambient, but can include dub, hip-hop, drum and bass, as well as any ethnic
					music, it can be creepy and a little dark, or unpredictable and dressed in noise, but it always retains
					its leisurely pace. Representatives of illbient includeDJ Spooky, We, Byzar, Tipsy, Specter, Rob
					Swift, Badawi.
				</li>
				<li>
					Combining ambient with psychedelic trance is called saibient.
				</li>
				<li>
					The chillout trend has also gained popularity.

			<p class="paragraph-dark ambient-text">
				"Industrial" culture discovered ambient through a loop (loop) - a looped piece of magnetic tape with a
				fragment of a recording, after a long listening to which an "internal wave effect" occurs, when a new
				fragment is born or imagined in a repeatedly repeated sound pattern, which gradually becomes brighter and
				brighter and comes to the fore, changing the main melody of the work. The second important invention was the
				drone (drone) - a multi-channel low-frequency rumble that makes up the mystical landscape of the work.
			</p>
			<p>
				Brian Williams (better known as Lustmord ) began releasing albums in 1980 that changed the foundations of
				ambient. Previously perceived as a relaxing experience and a background layer of everyday convenience,
				ambient suddenly acquired an almost religious aspect and functions of emotional theater. Lustmord became a
				pioneer of dark ambient â€” a symbiosis of low-frequency pulsations, fragments of ceremonial music and
				singing, recordings of natural noises, and a long rhythmic beat.

			<p>
				Space ambient or space music is a genre that is
				characterized by a measured, slow (rarely medium) tempo of sound. Synthetic, deaf and monotonous sounds are
				used, which, as a rule, are looped and serve as a background, on which additional rhythmic electronic losses
				are superimposed as the composition progresses. Often, muffled choral singing is used, disguised as music
				and modulations of synthetic melodies. It has a strong immersive atmosphere, calming and relaxing and
				meditative effects on the listener. Often found in soundtracks for space-themed games. Notable Artists:
				Michael Stearns, Jonn Serrie, Constance Demby, Telomere, Between Interval, UOK, Sula Bassana.

			</p>
			<h3 id="ambient_dub">Ambient dub</h3>
			<p class="p-ambient-dub">
				Ambient dub is a style that embodies the mixing of ambient with dub . The term was
				first used by the now-defunct Birmingham label Beyond Records in the early 1990s. The label released a
				series of albums, Ambient Dub Volume 1-4, which inspired many artists to release music in the genre,
				including Bill Laswell, who used a similar name for a series of his albums under the pseudonym Divination
				where he collaborated with other artists in the genre. Ambient dub correlates with dub styles popularized by
				King Tubbyand other Jamaican sound artists of the 1960s and early 1970s using ambient electronics that were
				inspired by early types of Jamaican dijeng. The style is characterized by drop-outs, echo, equalization and
				various psychedelic electronic effects. The genre often uses overdubbing techniques and contains elements of
				ethnic music, deep basses and harmonic sounds. In the words of writer and performer David Toop, "Dub
				music is like a long delay of echoes repeating in time... that turns the rational order of musical sequences
				into an ocean of feelings". Notable artists in the genre: Dreadzone, Higher Intelligence Agency, The
				Orb, Gaudi.

			</p>
			<h2 id="influence_on_other_genres">Influence on other genres</h2>
			<p>
				Ambient has been a major influence on New Age music. The roots of pre-ambient instrumental new age (Kitaro,
				Michael Hedges, Susan Chani, George Winston, Andreas Vollenweider) lie in jazz, folk, classical and
				synthesizer music. From the second half of the 1980s, new age, under the influence of ambient, turns into a
				song genre with a strong electronic component (Eniya , Enigma). Ambient also influenced the development of
				gothic rock, which resulted in ethereal wave.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the 1990s, sub-genres of alternative rock, such as post-rock or dream pop, are experiencing ambient
				influences. In metal, "atmospheric" sounds are becoming popular.
